Returning to the core functionality of Open Jedi Project. 

24/01/15 - Removed the possibility of self-teleporting (g_cmds.c / Void_TeleportPlayer // if (clid == clid2) , to avoid misuse.
Additionally, a teleport cooldown has been added, in order for the console to be able to process each request. This
exploit has been used to crash servers before, and is now fixed.  

24/01/15 - Disabled Makashi and Juyo form, due to simplicity and animational issues. 
The same goes for bots, who can only use Soresu/Shii/Djem at this point. 
These lightsaber forms can be re-introduced by including them in the string files (/ui/jamp/ingame_playerforce.cfg)
and by uncommenting the lines in ui_force.c ("setfp_green/purplestyle")

25/01/15 - Restricted Duals/Ataru & Staff/Niman form to their respective lightsaber hilts. These forms are
from this point on only accessible if you have the lightsaber hilts required to use them. No more using Ataru/Niman with a single lightsaber.

25/01/15 - Fixed a compiler issue where some clients would crash upon selecting force powers. 

Server compile: Debug(final)
Client compile: Final
